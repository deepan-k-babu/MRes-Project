Copy your Metagenomic Assembled Genomes to this folder before running the "Data_Preprocessing.ipynb" jupyter notebook codes. The MAGs used in this analysis are not my work. They are done by another student of my co-supervisor. So, I can't include his work. To get the MAGs I worked on, check the article "Recovery of metagenome-assembled genomes from the phyllosphere of 110 rice genotypes" (doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01320-7) and go to the supplementary data 2.
